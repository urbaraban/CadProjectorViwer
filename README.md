# MonchaCadView

A project to output drawings to a laser projector in real time.

I use a projector based on the Moncha controller, but all projectors support the same output standard (same mechanics) and the only question is in the connection library.

This project is an interface to my MonchaSDK library (in repositories) and the basic calculation algorithms are there.
